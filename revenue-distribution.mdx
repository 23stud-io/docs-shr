description: 'Understand the revenue distribution of the Shroomy Protocol'
---

The Shroomy Protocol generates revenue through various mechanisms including interest payments, liquidation fees, and flash loan fees. This revenue is systematically distributed according to a carefully designed model that balances ecosystem sustainability with stakeholder rewards.

## Allocation Framework

Shroomy Project implements a balanced 50/50 revenue split model:

- 50% to Shroomy Project Treasury: Half of all protocol revenue flows directly to the treasury, ensuring long-term sustainability and funding for protocol development, ecosystem growth, and operational expenses.
- 50% to Shroomy Project Staking Contract: The remaining half is allocated to the staking contract, which distributes rewards to protocol stakeholders who have staked their Shroomy Project tokens.

## Native Asset Distribution

A key feature of the Shroomy Project staking model is that rewards are distributed in their original form:

- Rewards are passed through to stakers in the same assets in which they were collected
- For example, if the protocol generates revenue in `WETH`, stakers receive their proportional share in `WETH`
- This applies to all supported assets, including stablecoins and other tokens
