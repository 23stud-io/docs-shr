The overall stability of the ShroomyProject Protocol relies heavily on the robustness of the collateralized positions within the ecosystem, which is measured by what we call the 'health factor'. When a user's account falls below a health factor of 1, the position becomes eligible for liquidation.

In the event that an account's health factor drops below the threshold of 1, any external party can initiate a liquidationCall() function to either the Pool or L2Pool contract (for Layer 2 networks). This process allows the liquidator to repay a portion of the outstanding debt and receive discounted collateral in return, known as the liquidation bonus.
