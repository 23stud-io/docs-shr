The Locker feature enables users to lock ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens on the Ink chain for a specified duration. Users can choose between a standard lock or a linear unlock (for ERC-20 tokens only) and select from a variety of lock durations. The system mints a proof-of-lock NFT to track locked tokens and supports advanced features like governance integration, lock extension, and ownership transfer.

## Supported Tokens

- ERC-20 Tokens: Fungible tokens supported for both standard and linear unlock mechanisms.
- ERC-721 Tokens [coming soon]: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) supported for standard lock only.

## Locking Options

### Standard Lock

- Tokens are locked for the entire selected duration.
- Tokens are released in full upon the lock's expiration.
- Available for both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens.

### Linear Unlock (ERC-20 Only)

- Tokens are gradually unlocked over time, proportional to the elapsed duration.
- Users can withdraw available tokens at any time.
- Example: For a 1-year linear unlock, after 6 months, 50% of the tokens are available for withdrawal.

## Lock Durations

Users can choose from the following lock durations:

- 7 days
- 14 days
- 1 month
- 3 months
- 6 months
- 9 months
- 1 year
- 2 years
- 3 years
- 4 years
- Forever (permanent lock)

## Proof-of-Lock NFT

Upon locking tokens, a proof-of-lock NFT is minted to the user's wallet.

This NFT tracks the locked tokens and their value, ensuring compatibility with wallet interfaces.

## Lock Management

### Extend Lock Duration

- Users can extend an existing lock by selecting from the same durations listed in Lock Durations (#lock-durations).
- The extension applies to the existing lock without requiring a new lock creation.

### Transfer Lock Ownership

- Users can transfer ownership of a lock to another address.
- This feature allows flexibility for users to delegate or reassign locked tokens.

## Emergency Unlocking

In case the web UI is unavailable, users can unlock or claim their tokens by interacting directly with the smart contract via a blockchain explorer. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Ink chain explorer.
- Locate the Locker contract address (available in the official documentation or support channels).
- Interact with the contract's unlock or claim functions, providing the necessary parameters (e.g., lock ID).
- Ensure you have sufficient gas for the transaction.
