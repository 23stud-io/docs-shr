The Airdrop Tooling feature allows users to distribute ERC-20 tokens to multiple addresses efficiently. Users can choose between a fixed amount airdrop, where all recipients receive the same token amount, or a variable amount airdrop, where amounts are specified via an uploaded CSV file. The system is designed to be user-friendly and secure, with clear feedback on airdrop execution.

## Supported Tokens

- ERC-20 Tokens: Fungible tokens on the Ink chain are supported for both fixed and variable amount airdrops.

## Airdrop Types

### Fixed Amount Airdrop

- All specified addresses receive the same amount of tokens.
- Users manually input:
  - The token contract address.
  - The fixed amount of tokens per address.
- A list of recipient addresses (entered manually or uploaded via CSV).
- Suitable for uniform distributions, such as community rewards or promotional campaigns.

### Variable Amount Airdrop

- Each address can receive a different amount of tokens, as specified in an uploaded CSV file.
- Users provide:
  - The token contract address.
  - A CSV file containing recipient addresses and corresponding token amounts.
- Suitable for customized distributions, such as tiered rewards or vesting payouts.

## CSV File Requirements (Variable Airdrop)

For variable amount airdrops, users must upload a CSV file with the following format:

- Columns:
  - `address`: The recipient's Ink chain address (must be a valid address).
  - `amount`: The token amount to send to the address (in the human-readable format, e.g., `1` for `1 ETH`).

Example:

```csv
address,amount
0x123...abc,1000000000000000000
0x456...def,500000000000000000
```

- Requirements:
  - The file must be in `.csv` format.
  - The first row must contain the headers address and amount.
  - All addresses must be valid Ink chain addresses.
  - Amounts must be positive integers or decimals compatible with the token's decimals.
- The UI validates the CSV file before allowing airdrop execution.
