The Shroomy Project staking mechanism is a core component of the protocol's economic model, designed to incentivize token holders who actively participate in securing and governing the ecosystem. By staking $SHROOMY tokens (the native token of Shroomy Project), participants receive protocol-derived incentives and gain governance rights proportional to their stake.

## Key Benefits

- **Protocol Incentives**: Earn protocol-derived incentives proportional to your staked amount
- **Native Asset Rewards**: Receive rewards in the same assets distributed by the protocol
- **Protocol Governance**: Participate in governance decisions that shape the future of Shroomy Project
- **Economic Alignment**: Align your interests with the long-term success of the protocol

## Staking Mechanism

### How Staking Works

1. **Deposit**: Users deposit $SHROOMY tokens into the staking contract
2. **Lock Period Selection**: Users must choose one of the available lock durations: 7, 30, 60, or 90 days
3. **Incentive Accrual**: Stakers earn their proportional share of the 50% of protocol fees allocated to the staking contract
4. **Epoch-Based Distribution**: Incentives are calculated and distributed in 24-hour epochs
5. **Claiming**: Accrued incentives can be claimed at any time, independent of the lock period

### Native Asset Distribution

A unique feature of Shroomy Project staking is that rewards maintain their original form:

- Rewards are distributed in the same assets in which they were generated
- If the protocol earns `WETH`, stakers receive `WETH`
- If the protocol earns `kBTC`, stakers receive `kBTC`
- This applies to all supported assets within the ecosystem

This approach provides stakers with a diverse basket of digital assets rather than a single token, creating natural portfolio diversification.

## Staking Parameters

### Lock Periods

Shroomy Project offers four fixed staking lock periods:
- **7 days**: Short-term staking option
- **30 days**: Medium-term staking option
- **60 days**: Extended staking option
- **90 days**: Long-term staking option

Each lock period represents a commitment to keep your tokens staked for the specified duration. During this period, tokens cannot be withdrawn, but continue to earn incentives.

### Epoch Structure

- **Epoch Duration**: 24 hours
- **Distribution Calculation**: Protocol fee distribution calculations occur at the end of each epoch
- **Incentive Accrual**: Incentives earned during an epoch become claimable immediately after epoch completion
- **Daily Claiming**: Users can claim accrued incentives after each epoch

## Claiming Incentives

### Daily Claiming

- **Daily Availability**: New incentives become available for claiming after each 24-hour epoch
- **Claim Frequency**: Users can claim their accrued incentives daily as soon as an epoch completes
- **No Lock-up**: Claimed incentives are transferred immediately to the user's wallet
- **Flexibility**: While daily claiming is available, users can choose to claim less frequently if desired
